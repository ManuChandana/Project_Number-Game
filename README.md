Project: Number Guessing Game
The Number Guessing Game is a Python program designed to entertain and engage users while introducing them to basic programming concepts. In this game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player's goal is to guess this number. 
Game Flow:
1. The game starts with a welcoming message and the computer randomly selects a number.
2. The player is prompted to input their guess.
3. The program provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether it is too low or too high.
4. The player continues to guess until they correctly identify the number.
5. The program keeps track of the number of attempts and congratulates the player upon a successful guess, displaying the total number of attempts made.
Technical Details:
- The game uses a simple while loop and decision-making statements (if..else) to control the flow and logic.
- It's an excellent introduction to Python programming, demonstrating basic user input, random number generation, and loop control.
